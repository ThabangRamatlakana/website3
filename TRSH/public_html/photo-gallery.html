                        <p> I am a Psychology Master's student. Teaching and learning are two of my greatest passions. <br>
                            I've dealt with children that have a range of learning disabilities (slow development, ADHD). <br>
                            I worked as a tutor at the<br> University of Pretoria. I was the third<br> year Psychology head tutor. <br>
                            My tutoring abilities were recognized<br> by the department. Furthermore, because of my psychology 
                            education, <br>I am able to identify each person as unique and recognize that each person learns in 
                            a different way.<br> As I've worked with my kids on basic developmental skills, I've developed a lot of 
                            patience. </p>

                            In 2016, I graduated with six distinctions and was consistently placed among the top three <br>
                            academically in my class. The IEB was the governing authority in charge of my matric certificate. <br>
                            At the University of Pretoria, I am currently pursuing a BSc(Hons) in Genetics. I am very aware of <br>
                            the difficulties that high school kids face, which is why I want to make the learning experience as <br>
                            pleasurable as possible for them. I also understand how challenging first-year Biological Sciences<br>
                            may be, and I'd like to help in any way I can.</p>

                        <p> I am now pursuing a mechanical engineering bachelor's degree. <br>
                            I hope that the knowledge I get from this course will enable me to be well-versed in dealing<br>
                            with the difficulties that the world faces, particularly those that we, as youth, face. <br>
                            In light of my objectives, I appreciate the time I spend interacting with young people <br>
                            from various backgrounds in order to gain a greater knowledge of how life is lived in various<br>
                            locations. This is accomplished via tutoring children and participating in youth organizations <br>
