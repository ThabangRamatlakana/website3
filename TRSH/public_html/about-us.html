                        <p>TRSH Is an organization about giving extra lessons and helping learners who are still in school. 
        This organization was introduced by Thabang in 2018. She is the founder and owner of the company and it <br>
        has been operating for the past 3 years. TRSH was first advertised by giving Flyers to nearby schools where 
        parents call for help with regards to her giving extra lessons to children who are struggling with their schoolwork. <br> 
        TRSH first started with one tutor which was the owner of the company until she realized that more students are coming 
        in and there's more work to be done so she then started to look for other professional tutors to come work in her company 
        so that they can work together in helping these learners who are still in school with all their schoolwork so that they can
        be able to achieve all their marks.</p>

                        <h2> Our History</h2>
    <p>
        TRSH was developed because most of the extra lessons institutions are expensive and most parents cannot
        afford it, which should not be a disadvantage for the learners who want to achieve good marks in school. The owner was 
        one of the learners who attended in one of the maths institute during her primary school years and her mother was paying more than R1000
        for an hour per subject.<br> While she was attending, a few months later she started seeing that most of the leaners were
        dropping out because of the difficulties of paying that much money. The owner, Thabang then had a wish that one day 
        after she is done with school, she would start her own tutoring company that will offer more hours of study and 
        charging less amount of money so that everyone can be able to get the help that they need.
    </p>
        
    
    <p>
         The biggest struggle for TRSH was getting students to teach but after trying and trying , TRSH  
         finally started with two learners,
         one in grade 4 and the other in grade7. After these learners improved with their marks, more students came and it became 
         so much that she got more tutors to help out.

         <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        Our mission is to help learners who are struggling with certain subjects in school by giving them extra lessons 
        and extra help so that they can develop the necessary knowledge and skills required for those subjects so that they 
        are able to pass
    </p>
    
     <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
        Our vision is to firstly make sure that all the students who receive extra lessons from TRSH are improving towards their 
        scholastic marks. Secondly, to change the mindsets of learners about the way Maths, Afrikaans and English are difficult, 
        that way once that mindset changes, it will draw positive energy and they will start wanting to learn more and develop
        interest in wanting to understand the subjects.<br> Thirdly, by achieving good marks, the vision is to change the mindset 
        of students to choose careers that are scarce in the country especially in the world of mathematics
